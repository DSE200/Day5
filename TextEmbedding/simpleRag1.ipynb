    "* Retrieval - Find relevant information given a query, e.g. \"what are the macronutrients and what do they do?\" -> retrieves passages of text related to the macronutrients from a nutrition textbook.\n",

    "## Why RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outputs of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prevent hallucinations - LLMs are incredibly good at generating good *looking* text, however, this text doesn't mean that it's factual. RAG can help LLMs generate information based on relevant passages that are factual.\n",
    "2. Work with custom data - Many base LLMs are trained with internet-scale data. This means they have a fairly good understanding of language in general. However, it also does a lot of their responses can be generic in nature. RAG helps to create specific responses based on specific documents (e.g. your own companies customer support documents)."

    "\\nExample 1:\n",
    "Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
    "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
    "\\nExample 2:\n",
    "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
    "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
    "\\nExample 3:\n",
    "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
    "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",

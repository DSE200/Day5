    "### Why text embeddings for prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a pretrained text embedding model is an easy way to turn variable-length product reviews into dense numeric vectors that encode semantics, allowing a compact neural network to learn a recommendation signal without relearning the entire language structure from scratch. This approach is absolutely doable for a classroom demo and keeps the workflow focused on the predictive task instead of low-level NLP feature engineering.\n"

Download `Womens Clothing E-Commerce Reviews.csv` from Kaggle, place it at `TextEmbedding/data/womens_clothing_reviews.csv`, and the notebook will predict whether a review recommends the product by feeding embeddings into a neural network.\n"
